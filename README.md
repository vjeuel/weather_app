You can access the app [here](https://vjeuel.github.io/weather_app).

## **About**
A live weather forecast for any location in the world, where you type a location and shows you the next 5 days forecast and the current weather.

In the 5 Days Forecast it will list:
- The name of the city searched
- The date of each day
- The Max temperature
- The Min temperature
- Humidity
- UV index
- and show an icon

In the Current Weather it will list:
- The name of the city searched
- Current temperature
- What does it feel like
- Current humidity
- Current wind speed
- UV index
- and an icon

Notice that when you choose the city and accordingly to the weather in that city, the background of the page will change to portrait the condition of the day, which it will be:
- Clouds and scattered clouds (cloudy day picture)
- Light rain, rain and shower rain (rainy day picture)
- Thunderstorm (stormy night picture)
- Snow (snowy day picture)
- Mist (misty city picture)

So I encourage you to find cities around the world that have a different weather condition so you can see the background picture changes.
